    <h3><span class="i18n">Case Studies</span>:</h3>

    <p class="i18n"><b>Online community management product</b> realized that human moderators were spending most of their time reviewing content that was falsely reported as bullying. MLDB.ai's data scientists developed a toxic content predictive model using NLP techniques that screened reports so that moderators only had to review content that was <i>too close to call</i>. This resulted in a 50% reduction in moderator workload while letting though only 5% of toxic messages. This is a
    great example of human augmentation.</p>
